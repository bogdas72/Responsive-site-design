                    <p>Hi. My name is Bogdan. <br> Some years ago I graduated high school in Computer Science. Then life took me in a different direction, and I became a car salesman, following my love for cars since I was a kid.</p> 
                    <p>17 years later, I decided it's time for a change, and came back to Computer Science. I'm aiming to become a Web Developer, and this <b>responsive</b> site was created by me as a learning exercise. <br>As I learned new skills, I used them in this site. It is stylized with Bootstrap, I made the picture gallery using CSS Grid and JavaScript for the functional part, and for the SQL example page and the login system I used MySQL, AJAX, JSON, PHP and JavaScript. <br>I hope you like it.</p>
